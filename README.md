Within the mountain of glass named Oronmaril lies an ancient artifact. The Chosen Lord will reward anyone with great riches who returns their sacred artifact.

Delve into the depths of the mountain of clear crystal. Darkness and death await you. In a place where the monsters see you first how do you navigate safely?

This project uses C and Lua. C is primarily used for expensive calculations (pathfinding via Djikstra maps), while the game's loop is in Lua.
Uses the [Whitebrim Playdate Project](https://github.com/Whitebrim/VSCode-PlaydateTemplate) template to compile and simulate for Lua and a custom CMake pipeline for C.
